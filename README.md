# Basic Network Setup Using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a basic network using switches, routers, and PCs in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It highlights essential skills for an IT Service Desk role, including network topology design, device configuration, and troubleshooting.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to set up a simple network topology and configure devices to enable seamless communication. This project showcases my ability to:
- Design and implement a network topology using switches, routers, and PCs.
- Assign IP addresses and configure static routing.
- Test and troubleshoot connectivity issues using tools like `ping` and `ipconfig`.

## Features

- **Network Topology**: 
  - One router connected to a switch.
  - Three PCs connected to the switch.
  - Devices assigned static IP addresses for communication.

- **Router Configuration**:
  - Configured interfaces for different subnets.
  - Enabled static routing for inter-device communication.

- **PC Configuration**:
  - Assigned IP addresses and default gateways.
  - Verified connectivity using ping tests.

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - Diagnosed and resolved issues such as incorrect IP configurations and connectivity failures.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Set Up Devices**:
   - Add one router, one switch, and three PCs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Connect them using copper straight-through cables.

2. **Configure the Router**:
   - Assign IP addresses to the router interfaces.
   - Enable the interfaces.

3. **Configure the Switch**:
   - Use default settings to connect PCs and the router.

4. **Assign IP Addresses to PCs**:
   - Use the static IP addressing method.

5. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Use the `ping` command to verify communication between devices.

6. **Troubleshoot**:
   - Resolve any connectivity issues that arise.
